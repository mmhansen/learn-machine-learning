# learn-machine-learning

## The plan

The plan is to get familiar with data science and its subset, machine learning.  
This is a place to keep awesome resources as well as my written learning guide for the next year.

I will keep a record of every article/resource/video that I watch/read and the dates I do so.  

For now, I'm just assembling tons of resources, but it will take a more certain shape once I understand the logical order of difficulty more clearly.
